In Blue Green Deployment, you have TWO complete deployments.
One is Blue deployment which is running and the 
Green deployment to which you want to upgrade. 
Once you swap the deployment from blue to green, 
the traffic is directed to your new green deployment. 
You can delete or save your old blue deployment for backup 
until the green deployment is stable.


In Rolling Deployment, you have only ONE complete deployment.
Once you start upgrading your deployment. 
The code is deployed in the subset of instances of the same deployment and 
moves to another subset after completion.

So both are different in various factors and you need to choose the deployment model
based on the scenario. Blue/green deployment is not a subset of rolling deployments.





Prometheus acts as the storage backend and Grafana as the interface for analysis and
visualization. 
Prometheus collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics from 
HTTP endpoints on these targets. ... 
By adding Grafana as a visualization layer,
we can easily set up a monitoring stack for our monitoring stack
